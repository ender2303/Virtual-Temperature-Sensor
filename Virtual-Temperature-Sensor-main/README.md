🔍 Why this matters? Companies like Siemens have worked on similar innovations, and this project was my sincere attempt to match that level of accuracy and reliability. I’ve focused on predicting internal motor temperature based on real-time parameters like current, torque, speed, and voltage — making it ideal for predictive maintenance.

The project involved developing a Virtual Temperature Sensor that can estimate the internal temperature of an electric motor without relying on physical temperature sensors. The goal was to leverage machine learning and domain-specific knowledge to create a reliable, real-time prediction system using existing motor parameters.
